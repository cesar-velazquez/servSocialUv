        <p>
            In this course you are not going to be working alone: different relationships need to be made. First of all,
            we need to set up an agreement between institutions, i.e. The University of Veracruz and the receiving
            institution, organization or industry where you will render your <i lang="es">Servicio Social</i>&nbsp; (<i
                lang="es">unidad receptora</i>). You will need to work with others such as your colleagues, your
            students and the authorities. And you should also maintain regular contact with your facilitator and
            classmates, both via your e-portfolio and by taking part in the regular forums and chat sessions that will
            be held.

                        Service began in Mexico in 1936. It was included in State Laws in 1939 as mandatory. Six months
                        is the minimum duration. The national association of higher education institutions (ANUIES)
                        created the national commission for Social Service in 1997.</p>

                        which is “to contribute to the integral development of the student, to develop their values and

                        It is your responsibility to find a receiving institution or organisation where you will render
                        your Social Service. The receiving institution can be in the public, private or voluntary sector
                        and at any level of education, but we ask for you to choose an institution which can offer you a
                        placement that will provide you with teaching hours. Once you have found a receiving
                        institution, the UV will send a letter, asking for the institution to support you and comply
                        with certain responsibilities while you are rendering your Social Service there, including
                        appointing an on-site coordinator for you.

                    <p>
                        When your placement has been formally confirmed, you can then begin your Social Service. There
                        are a series of course activities that you will be asked to carry out during your placement, as
                        well as some administrative duties. It is important that you keep a detailed record of
                        everything that you do for your placement: this can be used for your e-portfolio, and will help
                        you to fill in the monthly reports, which must be signed and stamped at your receiving
                        institution before you send them to me.

                    Then, the next essential step is to set up your own blog for your e-portfolio. There are many web
                    services that offer free blog sites, Blogger and WordPress being among the most well-known. Whilst
                    it is up to you to decide which service you use create your e-portfolio, Blogger is one of the
                    simplest (and, therefore, easiest to use) options. Tutorial:

                    It is your responsibility to find a receiving institution or organisation where you will render your
                    Social Service. The receiving institution can be in the public, private or voluntary sector and at
                    any level of education, but we ask for you to choose an institution which can offer you a placement
                    that will provide you with teaching hours. Once you have found a receiving institution, the UV will
                    send a letter, asking for the institution to support you and comply with certain responsibilities
                    while you are rendering your Social Service there, including appointing an on-site coordinator for
                    you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your placement has been formally confirmed, you can then begin your Social Service. There are a
                    series of course activities that you will be asked to carry out during your placement, as well as
                    some administrative duties. It is important that you keep a detailed record of everything that you
                    do for your placement: this can be used for your e-portfolio, and will help you to fill in the
                    monthly reports, which must be signed and stamped at your receiving institution before you send them
                    to me.

            <h2 class="subtitulo-mor">Finding a placement</h2>

            <p>In order to begin your <i lang="es">Servicio Social</i>&nbsp;, you first need to find a receiving
                institution where you will carry out your service. Typically, this is done in a school or language
                institute. In Eminus, you will find a file (Receiving Units catalogue) in Important Documents with a
                list of institutions where students have done their placements in previous years. You may be interested
                in doing your placement in one of these institutions, or you might want to look for a different one
                (this will depend partly on where you are located). Please note that as of September 2015, there is a
                new law which requires official permission to be granted for placements in all SEP affiliated
                institutions at <i lang="es">Pre-escolar</i>&nbsp; to <i lang="es">Preparatoria</i>&nbsp; level. For
                those of you in the state of Veracruz, we can do the relevant paperwork for you here in <i
                    lang="es">Xalapa</i>, once you have provided us with the full details of the institution.</p>

            <p>To formalise your placement, an agreement needs to be formed between the <i lang="es">Facultad de
                    Idiomas</i>&nbsp; and the receiving institution. You will be sent a digital copy of a personalised
                letter to be handed in at your receiving institution, and you will need to ask the institution for a
                letter of acceptance in return (there is an example in the files attached). You will also need to fill
                out a registration form (<i lang="es">directorio individual</i>, attached), for our records.</p>
